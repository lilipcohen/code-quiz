# code-quiz
## Overview
For this assignment I was to create a quiz containing questions about coding. When the user looks at the introduction at the beginning and they hit start the coding quiz will begin. The timer counting down from fifty will start and the quiz questions will appear one at a time. Every time the user gets a question wrong the timer will go down by 5 seconds. On the last question the user will be directed to a Game Over screen prompting them to put in their initials and to start the quiz over if desired. If the timer runs out however the user will be put automatically to the Game Over screen. 

There should have been stored data with their initials and a screen that appears to reveal their score along with their initials and the previously played and stored scores as well but I did not get to that point unfortunately.
